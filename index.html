<h1>Having a broad range of experience, I possess proficiency in financial signal processing, AI trading, mathematics and physics, as well as graphic design. My enthusiasm for technology and innovation is matched by my mastery in Python, React Native and Node.js for full-stack development. 

In my professional life thus far, I have confronted stimulating challenges related to algorithmic trading, deep reinforcement learning and data analysis. As an educator and mentor for aspiring professionals within the technological field, I convey my expertise with patience and dedication. I have taught courses on topics such as fundamentals of physics, game development, and innovation and entrepreneurship, and I take pride in guiding students to reach their full potential.

Whether employed as a project manager, software engineer or teacher, my mindset is results-oriented yet strategic. By demonstrating a keen attention to detail coupled with the ability to generate new and original ideas, I have consistently challenged conventional thinking and set new standards for innovation and achievement.</h1>
